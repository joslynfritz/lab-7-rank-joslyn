Hello, this is Joslyn's first message in the document. 

If you are the collaborator: 
- load the tidyverse
- read in the kermit data as 'kermit'
- make some side-by-side histograms of the score.pre for all respondents, separated by the Gender column. 

```{r}

library(tidyverse)

kermit <- read_csv("kermit.csv")

kerm_hist <- ggplot(kermit, aes(x = Score.pre)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 4) +
  facet_wrap(~Gender)
kerm_hist

```
